# Multiagent-System-Communication_ROS-SPADE-Integration
- Authors: Ane López and Maite López

> Making use of multi-agent systems, it is possible to satisfy the decentralization and connectivity requirements of the various production environments. 
> This project aims to: develop a platform based on Python for the creation of components for the integration of physical resources to a production environment.
> The correct performance of this industrial agent platform based on SPADE will be reaffirmed through the simulation of a digital twin, which will process the tasks
> of an automatic storage Component I4.0 and will integrate an OPC UA communication interface. 
> In addition, the machine will maintain communication with other assets of the factory, such as AGVs (Automatic Guided Vehicles),
> with which it will exchange requests for different services.
